🏋️‍♂️ AI Push-Ups Counter using Hand Gesture Control is a smart web-based fitness app that counts push-ups in real time using AI-powered hand gesture recognition and camera tracking. It offers a touch-free, accurate, and interactive workout experience directly in the browser—no wearables or manual input needed.

🏋️‍♀️ AI Push-Ups Counter Using Hand Gesture Control
📌 Project Overview

The AI Push-Ups Counter using Hand Gesture Control is an intelligent web-based fitness application that automatically detects, tracks, and counts push-ups in real time by analyzing hand gestures and body movement through the device camera.

Unlike traditional fitness apps that require manual input or wearable devices, this project uses AI-based hand gesture recognition to provide a touch-free, accurate, and interactive workout experience directly in the browser.

🧠 Core Concept

This project combines:

🤖 Artificial Intelligence

✋ Hand Gesture Recognition

📷 Computer Vision

🌐 Web Technologies (HTML-based)

The system continuously tracks hand position and movement patterns during a push-up and counts only valid repetitions, ensuring better accuracy.

✨ Key Features

✅ Real-time push-up counting
✅ Hand gesture–based motion detection
✅ No buttons, no wearables, no manual counting
✅ Camera-based, touch-free interaction
✅ Lightweight and fast browser execution
✅ Beginner-friendly user interface
✅ Works directly from a web browser

✋ Hand Gesture Control – How It Works

1️⃣ The camera captures live video frames
2️⃣ AI detects hand landmarks and movement direction
3️⃣ Downward and upward hand motion during push-ups is tracked
4️⃣ A complete push-up cycle is identified using gesture logic
5️⃣ Counter increases only when a correct motion is detected

🔹 This prevents false counts caused by partial or incorrect movements.
